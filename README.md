# RISC-V CPU Core (RV32I)

A simple single-cycle RISC-V (RV32I) CPU core implemented in Verilog.

## Features
- Instruction Fetch
- Instruction Decode
- Register File
- ALU (ADD, ADDI)
- Write-back stage
- Verified using testbenches and waveform analysis in Vivado

## Tools
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado

## Status
Currently supports basic RV32I instructions.  
Planned extensions include more instructions and pipelining.
