# RISC-V CPU Core (Verilog)

A simple RV32I CPU core implemented from scratch using Verilog.

## Features
- Program Counter and Instruction Fetch
- Instruction Decode
- Register File
- ALU (ADD, ADDI)
- Write-back stage
- Verified using self-written testbenches and waveform analysis in Vivado

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado

## Status
Work in progress. Planned extensions include more ALU instructions, branching, memory operations, and pipelining.
